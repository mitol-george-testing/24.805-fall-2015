description: "Made famous by Ludwig Wittgenstein in his Philosophical Investigations,\
  \ this image of a rabbit (or a duck?) features the caption \"Welche Thiere gleichen\
  \ einander am meisten?\" which translates to \"Which animals are most like each\
  \ other?\" Wittgenstein used this image to describe two different ways of seeing:\
  \ seeing that/seeing as. Selections from Wittgenstein\u2019s Philosophical Investigations\
  \ are assigned readings for Session 2. This image is in the public domain."
